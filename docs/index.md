# Welcome to UBELIX OnDemand

!!! warning
    This is a pre-release version of the UBELIX OnDemand portal. There will be bugs. Please report them at [https://serviceportal.unibe.ch/hpc](https://serviceportal.unibe.ch/hpc).

UBELIX OnDemand is an exciting new service providing easy access to the HPC system at Unibe, designed with user-friendliness in mind.

With the new OnDemand portal available at [https://ondemand.hpc.unibe.ch](https://ondemand.hpc.unibe.ch), you can:

- **Browse Files:** Easily navigate your files, with the option to upload and download smaller files for quick access and management.
- **View Jobs:** Keep track of your currently running jobs, helping you stay informed about your computational tasks.
- **Web-Based Shell Sessions:** Start a web-based shell session on a UBELIX submit node, allowing you to interact with the system without needing a local terminal.
- **Jupyter Lab/Notebook:** Launch a Jupyter Lab/Notebook server on a compute node directly from your browser, ideal for data analysis, scientific computing, and interactive coding.
- **(VS)Code Server:** Start a (VS)Code server on a compute node, enabling you to code and develop directly in your browser with the powerful features of Visual Studio Code.

Please note that while UBELIX OnDemand offers a user-friendly, interactive interface, it does not replace the command line login to UBELIX. The command line remains the more powerful option for performing extensive and complex tasks, offering greater flexibility and control over your computing environment. UBELIX OnDemand is a new low barrier entry to the HPC system at Unibe.
